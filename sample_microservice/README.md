# Go micro-service in ~30 minutes

This is a Go micro-service written from scratch.

It shows how to use [net/http](https://godoc.org/net/http), and how to structure a Go project.

It relies on Go 1.11 Beta 2 and the upcoming "Go modules" (formerly known as "vgo") support.

Dependency injection is used to insert a logger instance into the handler.

You can also notice how the test is constructed in order to provide testing for the handler.

A Docker container is available, thanks to the Dockerfile. It shows how to construct such containers.

## How to use

Because this project uses go modules, as long as you are using Go 1.11 Beta 2+ or Go 1.10 with vgo support,
you should be ok.

Clone this anywhere in your computer and create a project in your editor. I'm using [GoLand IDE](https://jetbrains.com/go) in order to work
on the project during the presentation as well as have support for go modules.

The bundled, self-signed, certificates are bound to either ` dev.localhost:8080 ` or ` docker.localhost:8080 `. I obviously
do not recommend using these in production.

I created this as part of the presentation at [GopherCon UK 18](https://www.gophercon.co.uk/).
